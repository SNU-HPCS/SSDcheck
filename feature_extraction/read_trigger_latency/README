This is for read-triggering buffer flush ssds.

(1) Check whether ssd has read-triggering buffer flush property or not

Use read_trigger.fio job file. You can run command like below.

sudo DEV_NAME="dev_name" THINK_TIME="time" ../../benchmark/fio/fio read_trigger.fio

If you wnat to change target ssd (default is /dev/sdc), you may modify the job file.
Results will be stored in current directory, whose name starts with "read_trigger_test". 


(2) Check read latency with various number of writes per read

Run ./run_all.sh. This shell script will use test.fio 
Results will be stored in ../../result/${SSD_NAME}/latency_read-trigger directory.

(3) Check "normal" read latency.

"Normal" read latency means read-request's latency collected by ruuning fio job that has no write request inside.
 
Use normal-read.fio job file. You can run command like below.

sudo ../../benchmark/fio/fio normal-read.fio 

If you want to change target ssd (default is /dev/sdc), you may modify the job file.
Results will be stored in current directory.


(4) Check read latency with various write ratio

Use mix_readwrite_ratio.fio.
You can run command like below.
sudo READ_RATIO=70 WRITE_RATIO=30 ../../benchmark/fio/fio mix_readwrite_ratio.fio

If you want to change target ssd (default is /dev/sdc), you may modify the job file.

Results will be stored in current directory.
